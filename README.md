### SPECS/Source/Releases for testing XFCE4 on Wayland/labwc on el10/clones

*This is only for testing/not production.*

*XFCE4  is functional on EL10/clones when built for pure wayland*

Recent rebuilds have resolved most outstanding issues.
  
  Desktop displays normally.
  Most all plugins seem to work now.

*Rebuilding both sets x86_64(v3, the default) and x86_64_v2(for older hw)
Soon I will upload the  SRPMS here, and release tarballs of the RPMS.


*I'm also building some applications from goffice, those will go in another GH project.
