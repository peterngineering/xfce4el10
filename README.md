### Source/Releases for testing XFCE4 on Wayland/labwc on el10/clones

*This is only for testing/not production.*

*XFCE4  is functional on EL10/clones but the default configurations I'm using needs work still.*

*At this time, xfce4-panel is the main parent process under labwc/wayland, and you must (for now) manually choose fullscreen on startup, to properly place the panel*
